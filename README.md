# LCProject
Irish Leaving Certificate Project 2020, the first time the course was examined in Ireland. The project description was to find a dataset, with data on climate change, and parse this data with a python program. Store this semi-structured data in a NoSQL database like firebase and then design a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show the data generated in the form of interesting and engaging visualisations, graphs essentially. This GitHub repo contains my attempt at this project, though unfortunately Covid-19 disrupted the examination process resulting in this project never being examined, it was completed and uploaded here! 

You can examine all the files in this directory at your own convenience. If you wish to view the website, you can find it at this address: [ENTER WEBSITE LINK]
